3. NotesPro is the main python flask file (there's a def loadSites funtion which has all that list splitting code. U can remove that as it doesn't work)





4. websites is a text file containing the list of websites for different subjects, from where the data will be scraped from the desired topic. There is a slash Y after each website meaning yes.

5. hey.py is blank


6. result.html is a html file to display something after processing(it won't work properly i think)

9. Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces on computers. It divides a given application into three interconnected parts. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to, and accepted from, the user.The MVC design pattern decouples these major components allowing for efficient code reuse and parallel development.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller
