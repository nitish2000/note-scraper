# note-scraper
1. noteHome is the html file for the main webpage in which we have used bootstrap, html, css and jinja.








2. searchMaths, searchPhys etc for specific subjects.







3. NotesPro is the main python flask file (there's a def loadSites funtion which has all that list splitting code. U can remove that as it doesn't work)





4. websites is a text file containing the list of websites for different subjects, from where the data will be scraped from the desired topic. There is a slash Y after each website meaning yes. (Actually it should be changed to yes or no by the program according to the subject. eg: while searching for a topic in maths, the websites for the websites pertaing to other subjects must hav /n for no.


5. hey.py is blank


6. result.html is a html file to display something after processing(it won't work properly i think)


7. there are jpeg images and there is hi.py which contains some code regarding regular expressions. basically it's about pulling websites from the websites text file but it's incomplete.
